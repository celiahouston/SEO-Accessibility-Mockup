# SEO-Accessibility-Mockup
  In this project, I wanted to refactor a given code for a Horiseon homepage mock-up. I adapted the HTML code to be more semantically correct, for example, ensuring images were tagged correctly and <div> elements were used when necessary and appropriate. 
  The goal of this project was accessibility and semantically correct HTML code, as well as ensuring linked CSS was adapted as required. 
  This allowed me to examine more closely the specifics of "Semantic HTML".
